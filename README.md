# RustCloud
Rust Point Cloud library

# Objectives

Create a Rust library for point cloud processing and analysis.

Features

1) Simple geometry
   1) Fit points to planes
   2) Point to plane distance
   3) Projections 3D -> 2D
2) Spatial partitioning: Answer nearest neighbour queries etc.
   1) Octree
   2) kd-tree
3) Triangulation: Generate polygons/meshes/terrain models.
   1) Delaunay triangulation
4) Registration: Align overlapping point clouds
